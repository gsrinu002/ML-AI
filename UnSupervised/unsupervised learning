unsupervised learning 
------------------------ 

in this kind of learning technique no superviser is available. 

in this models no labeled data is providing to the machine. 

It tries to learn the patterns and structure form the inputs with out having any outputs. 

key points 
--------------
1. Discover hidden pattrens 
2. group similar data points (clustring)
3. reduce dimentationality 
4. find associations between the features 

Clustring 
--------------
 cusomer segmentation 
 image recognition 
 credit card fraud  seggregation 
 cancer detection 
 color pallets 
 object detection 
 divide shapes of the data 
 voters segmentation
